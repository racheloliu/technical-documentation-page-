         <p>HTML is a markup language, as evidenced by its name, Hyper Text Markup Language. A markup language is what is used to write out text for a webpage and have it show up in your browser.</p>
          <p>Depending on the syntax used, HTML can categorize text in a hierarchy of header, paragraph, list, etc., and organize textual information</p>
          <p>HTML can be linked to CSS to adjust its appearance, which is why HTML and CSS are often spoken of in tandem.</p>
          <code>!DOCTYPE html</code>
          <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and through links, can change everything from the background, images, and even text itself through, for example, color and font.</p>
          <code>body {
            background-color: blue;
          }
          </code>
          <p>Often if a developer is coding HTML, they are referencing and ajusting CSS code at the same time, and vice versa.</p>

          <p>For websites, it can communicate with HTML/CSS elements for interactivity.</p>
      <code>getElementById()</code>
          <p>JavaScript can reference files outside of what you see on a website, and can even change HTML or CSS.</p>
